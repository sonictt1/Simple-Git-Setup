# simple_git_setup_windows
A quick-and-dirty git bash setup for Git Bash on Windows.
Open the Git Bash program in Windows, navigate to the script's containing folder, and then run the *.sh file.

The program will set your user.name and user.email fields, default your push and pull methods to "matching", set some useful shortcuts (those shortcuts will print on screen), and it will generate an ssh key and copy it to your clipboard for you.
